# F1-Data
A quick project messing with F1 data and python and pandas.

SO FAR... 

I've utilized csv file reading and writing, merging, sorting by values, columns, duplicate removal, and more.


Tasks achieved:

in random_1.py :
- Finding the highest scoring year for each constructor by merging race results with constructors

in winnerPerYear.py :
- written a script to find not only the winner each year but their point total using 3 different csv files. the option to write to a csv file is present as well.

MOVING FORWARD:

i hope to learn some about data visualiztion and get to graphing this stuff.. hopefully with matplotlib or other tools... should be exciting!!
