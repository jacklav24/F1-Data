# F1-Data
A quick project messing with F1 data and python and pandas.

SO FAR... 

Obviously, none of this is up to industry standards and practices when it comes to the styling, formatting, and probably efficiency of the code.
But I'm figuring things out on the go!

I've utilized csv file reading and writing, merging, sorting by values, columns, duplicate removal, and more.


Tasks achieved:

in random_1.py :
- Finding the highest scoring year for each constructor by merging race results with constructors

in winner_per_year.py :
- written a script to find not only the winner each year but their point total using 3 different csv files. the option to write to a csv file is present as well.

in constructors.py:
- created a way to view the results of all constructors in either a) all years of f1 competition, or b) a year range inputted by the user. This uses 
all of the skills mentioned so far, and incorporates some more (relatively speaking) intense pandas and m atplotlib manipulation.

MOVING FORWARD:

i hope to learn some about data visualiztion and get to graphing this stuff.. hopefully with matplotlib or other tools... should be exciting!!

update 1:  I've gotten more familiar with matplotlib, and pandas in general. I could be much more efficient in general with my code.
           Lots more to set up.
